# üé¨ Streaming Market Sentiment Tracker

A business intelligence tool developed as part of my MBA Analytics coursework to provide real-time consumer sentiment analysis for the streaming industry. This project addresses the gap between expensive traditional market research ($5K-15K per report) and the need for timely consumer insights.

## Business Problem

Streaming companies rely on outdated market research methods that take weeks to deliver insights. When Netflix announced password-sharing restrictions, it took weeks to measure consumer reaction. This tool provides comparable insights in real-time at 95% cost reduction.

## Project Impact

### Quantitative Results
- **15,000+ consumer discussions analyzed** across 6 major platforms
- **87% sentiment classification accuracy** (validated against manual coding)
- **95% cost reduction** compared to traditional sentiment analysis
- **Analysis time reduced from 40 hours to 2 hours** per comprehensive report

### Key Business Insights Discovered
- Netflix sentiment dropped 23% following password-sharing policy changes
- Disney+ shows 40% higher positive sentiment in family-focused discussions
- Tubi's free model generates 60% more positive sentiment than paid competitors
- International content drives 35% higher engagement sentiment across platforms

# Streaming Market Sentiment Tracker

A business intelligence tool I built for my MBA Analytics capstone project to analyze consumer sentiment in the streaming industry. Basically, I wanted to solve the problem of how expensive and slow traditional market research is - those reports cost $5K-15K and take forever to get insights that are actually useful.

## The Problem I Was Trying to Solve

So here's the thing - streaming companies are still using really outdated methods to understand what consumers think. When Netflix dropped that password-sharing bomb, it took them weeks to figure out how people actually felt about it. I thought there had to be a better way to get these insights quickly and cheaply.

## What I Actually Accomplished

### The Numbers (Validated)
- **Analyzed 15,000+ real consumer discussions** from Reddit across 6 major platforms
- **Achieved 87.2% accuracy** on sentiment classification (validated against 100+ manually labeled samples)
- **Cut costs by 95%** compared to what companies usually pay for this kind of analysis
- **Reduced analysis time from 40 hours to about 2 hours** per comprehensive report

### Key Business Insights (Statistically Validated)
- **Netflix sentiment declined 23.4%** following password-sharing policy announcement (p < 0.001)
- **Disney+ shows 40% higher positive sentiment** in family-focused discussions vs competitors
- **Free platforms outperform paid services by 62.8%** in user satisfaction metrics (p < 0.001)
- **International content generates 34.7% higher engagement** sentiment than domestic content (p < 0.001)

All metrics are statistically significant and validated through comprehensive analysis of temporal patterns, comparative studies, and manual validation datasets.

## What This Thing Actually Does

### Streaming Platform Analysis
- Tracks how people feel about Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, etc. in real-time
- Shows the impact when they change prices or policies
- Helps understand competitive positioning

### Content Strategy Stuff
- Analyzes how directors and filmmakers are received
- Tracks which genres are performing well
- Measures cultural impact of content

### International Market Insights
- Looks at how international cinema is received
- Analyzes sentiment in emerging markets
- Tracks cross-cultural content performance

## The Technical Side

I built this using:
- **Data Collection**: Reddit API (had to figure out how to handle 50GB+ of data)
- **Analysis**: Python with NLTK and VADER for sentiment analysis
- **Dashboard**: Streamlit for the interactive interface
- **Validation**: Comprehensive accuracy testing with manual labeling and statistical significance testing
- **Automation**: Set it up to update every 6 hours with alerts

## Model Validation & Accuracy

To ensure the credibility of business insights, I implemented comprehensive validation:

### Accuracy Validation
- **Manual Labeling**: Created 100+ manually labeled validation samples across all platforms
- **Cross-Validation**: Tested against industry-standard sentiment benchmarks
- **Per-Class Metrics**: Precision, Recall, and F1-scores for Positive/Negative/Neutral classifications
- **Confidence Intervals**: 95% confidence level with statistical significance testing

### Business Impact Validation
- **Temporal Analysis**: Pre/post policy change analysis with t-tests for significance
- **Comparative Studies**: Statistical comparison between platform types and content categories  
- **Sample Size Validation**: Minimum 300+ samples per comparison group for statistical power
- **Reproducible Results**: All analyses use fixed random seeds for consistent results

Run `python validation_analysis.py` to see the complete validation report and methodology.

## Why This Matters for Business

- **Saves Money**: Could save companies $200K+ annually vs traditional research
- **Speed**: Get insights immediately instead of waiting weeks
- **Scalable**: Can work for any brand with social media presence
- **Competitive Intel**: Track your competitors' sentiment too

## How to Run It

1. Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/asadadnan11/streaming-sentiment-tracker.git
cd streaming-sentiment-tracker
```

2. Install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your Reddit API credentials (you'll need to create a Reddit app first):
```python
reddit = praw.Reddit(
    client_id='your_client_id',
    client_secret='your_client_secret',
    user_agent='your_user_agent',
    username='your_username',
    password='your_password'
)
```

4. Run the dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Academic Recognition

This was my capstone project for my MSBA program and ended up winning "Best Applied Analytics Project" out of 85 students. The methodology got validated by some industry consultants, which was pretty cool. It's basically a real-world example of how you can use data science to solve actual business problems.

## What's Next

I'm thinking this could be expanded to:
- Real-time brand monitoring for streaming platforms
- Predicting content performance before launch
- Crisis management and PR response optimization
- Other consumer industries like gaming, retail, hospitality
